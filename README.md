# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

My attempt at solving problems from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/), in Rust and Python. Feel free to provide feedback regarding solutions or project structure.

## Rust and Python Split

Since I wish to practice both Python and Rust, I will be solving problems in both languages.
Here I will keep track of which problem is solved in which programming language. Hope it clears things up!

## How to run solutions

Each project contains a `input.txt` file, with the puzzle input. 

In order to run a solution in Rust, you will need to [install cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Then, run any Rust project as such to see the solution:

```bash
# Select a project, run its code
cd day_1_a
cargo run --release
```

In order to run a solution in Python, you will need to [install python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run any Python project as such to see the solution:

```bash
# Select a project, run its code
cd day_3_a
python3 solution.py
```
